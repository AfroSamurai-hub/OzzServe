# AI Scope: Assistive-Only Policy (LOCKED)

This document defines the immutable boundaries of AI integration in OzzServe.

## Assistive AI Only
AI is strictly an assistive tool and must not act as a primary decision-maker for critical business logic.

## Forbidden AI Decisions
The following actions must NEVER be performed or decided by an AI model:
1. **Money Movement**: AI cannot authorize payouts, refunds, or fee adjustments.
2. **Account Bans**: AI cannot permanently ban or suspend users/providers.
3. **Dispute Resolution**: Final judgements on disputes must be made by human admins.
4. **Contract Modification**: AI cannot unilaterally change pricing or contract terms.

## AI Toggle
Every user interface featuring AI-generated suggestions must include a clear "Disable AI Suggestions" toggle.

## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Any AI-generated content (e.g., automated summaries) must be clearly labeled as "AI-Generated" and provide a mechanism for human review/correction.
