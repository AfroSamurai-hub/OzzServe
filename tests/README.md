# Test Layers: OzzServe

This directory contains the testing suite for the OzzServe project. Tests are organized into three layers:

## 1. Unit Tests
Focus on individual functions and components in isolation (e.g., utility functions, state transition logic).

## 2. Integration Tests
Verify interactions between multiple components or systems (e.g., API endpoints, database interactions, webhook processing).

## 3. E2E (End-to-End) Tests
Validate entire user journeys from start to finish (e.g., booking a service and completing payment).

## Stubs
The `stubs/` directory contains placeholder tests for critical paths that will be fully implemented alongside the application features.
